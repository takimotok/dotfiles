# EXTRA VARIABLES

# GROUP OVERRIDES
#
# You can override global settings from [note] and [extra] for a particular
# group of notes by declaring a [group."<name>"] section.
#
# Specify the list of directories which will automatically belong to the group
# with the optional `paths` property.
#
# Omitting `paths` is equivalent to providing a single path equal to the name of
# the group. This can be useful to quickly declare a group by the name of the
# directory it applies to.

# LSP

#   Configure basic editor integration for LSP-compatible editors.

# Filter out the completion pop-up using the note title or its path.

# NAMED FILTERS
[filter]

# Matches the notes created the last two weeks. For example:
#    $ zk list recents --limit 15
#    $ zk edit recents --interactive
#recents = "--sort created- --created-after 'last two weeks'"


# COMMAND ALIASES
#
#   Aliases are user commands called with `zk <alias> [<flags>] [<args>]`.
#
#   The alias will be executed with `$SHELL -c`, please refer to your shell's
#   man page to see the available syntax. In most shells:
#     * $@ can be used to expand all the provided flags and arguments
#     * you can pipe commands together with the usual | character
#
[alias]
# list notes for editing
ls = "zk edit --interactive $@"
ll = "zk list --quiet --format oneline $@"

# Edit the last modified note.
el = "zk edit --limit 1 --sort modified- $@"

# Print paths separated with new lines for the notes found with the given arguments.
# This can be useful to expand a complex search query into a flag taking only paths.
# For example:
#   zk list --link-to "`zk path -m potatoe`"
pl = 'zk list --quiet --format {{path}} --delimiter "\n" $@'

# search notes by tags
t = "zk edit --interactive --tag $@"

# open last zk in slides
slides = "zk list --interactive --quiet --format path --delimiter0 $@ | xargs -0 slides"

# Edit this configuration file.
conf = '$EDITOR "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zk/config.toml"'
